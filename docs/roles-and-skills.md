## Personal reflection
I chose backend development, because it's interesting for me, I like abstractions and designing large and high-loaded systems which a lot of users will use. So, I particulary correspond to the market demands, but I need to learn some important concepts to start work. I'd like to learn more about backend architecture and approaches for designing large systems, also I'd like to learn testing, it helps me to get work on junior+/middle position.
